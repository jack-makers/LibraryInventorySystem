# LibraryInventorySystem



# Project Plan:
Design a full stack web application utilizing ASP.NET MVC. The application will simulate an inventory system for a public or private  library. The user will be able to log into the web application and perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete)  operations to manage their inventory.
